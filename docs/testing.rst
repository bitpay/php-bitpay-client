=======
Testing
=======

Testing ensures that code is stable and that the code quality is high by holding
every person to the same standards. Before you start, please make sure you have
install the required development dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    composer.phar install

.. note::

    By default Composer will install the development packages. You should
    not need to run ``install`` or ``update``.

PHPUnit
=======

To run phpunit, use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    php bin/phpunit -c build/

This will run the tests and will also generate the code coverage reports which
you can view by opening the HTML files generated in the ``build/docs/code-coverage``.

You can also run phpunit on just one file, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    php bin/phpunit -c build/ tests/Bitpay/PrivateKeyTest.php

Running tests on just one file can be helpful since you are not running the
entire test suite.

PHP_CodeSniffer
===============

Please make sure your code is PSR1 and PSR2 compliant. To do this, ``phpcs``
has been include in the require-dev section of composer and also is part of
the build process on Travis CI.

To make sure your code is compliant, please run the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    php bin/phpcs -n --standard=PSR1,PSR2 --report=full src/

Please fix any violations that are found.
