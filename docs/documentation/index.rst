Documentation
=============

Documentation is built using `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ and
can be built using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_

To build the docs, make sure you install Sphinx. Change directories to ``docs``
run the command ``make html`` and just open up the files that are generated in
the ``docs/_build/html`` directory.

For more information on installing Sphinx, see http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html
