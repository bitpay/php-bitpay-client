# Configuration

See https://labs.bitpay.com/t/php-bitpay-client-library-configuration/555

# Usage

## Autoloader

To use the library's autoloader (which doesn't include composer dependencies)
instead of composer's autoloader, use the following code:

```php
<?php
$autoloader = __DIR__ . '/relative/path/to/Bitpay/Autoloader.php';
if (true === file_exists($autoloader) &&
    true === is_readable($autoloader))
{
    require_once $autoloader;
    \Bitpay\Autoloader::register();
} else {
    throw new Exception('BitPay Library could not be loaded');
}
```

## Documentation

Please see the ``docs`` directory for information on how to use this library
and the ``examples`` directory for examples on using this library. You should
be able to run all the examples by running ``php examples/File.php``.
